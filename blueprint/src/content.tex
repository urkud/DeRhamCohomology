\chapter{Continuous alternating maps}

\begin{definition}%
  \label{def:cont-alt-map}
  \lean{ContinuousAlternatingMap}
  \leanok%
  A \emph{continuous alternating map} from \(E^{I}\) to \(F\),
  where \(E\) and \(F\) are topological vector spaces
  over a nontrivially normed field \(\mathbb k\)
  and \(I\) is an index type (usually, \texttt{Fin n} for some \(n\)),
  is a map \(f\colon E^{I} \to F\) such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n - 1})\) is linear in each variable \(x_{i}\);
  \item \(f\) is a continuous map.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We will use notation\todo{Better \LaTeX\ notation.} \(E [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\)
for the type of continuous alternating maps from \(E^{I}\) to \(F\).
We will also write (in the blueprint but not in Lean code)
\(E [\bigwedge^{k}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\) for \(E [\bigwedge^{\Fin k}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\).

\subsection{Arithmetic}%
\label{sec:arithmetic}

\begin{theorem}%
  \label{thm:normed-grp}
  If \(E\) is a seminormed space over \(\mathbb k\) and \(F\) is a (semi)normed space over \(\mathbb k\),
  then \(k\)-alternating maps from \(E\) to \(F\) form a (semi)normed space over \(\mathbb k\).
  The addition and scalar multiplication are pointwise, and the norm is given by
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:alt-norm}
    \|f\| = \operatorname{Inf} \left\{C \mid C \ge 0 \wedge \forall m, \|f(m)\| \le C\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}\|m_{i}\|\right\}.
  \end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Composition}%
\label{sec:composition}

\begin{theorem}%
  \label{thm:clm-comp}
  If \(g\colon F \to G\) is a continuous linear map between topological vector spaces over \(\mathbb k\)
  and \(f\colon E [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\) is a continuous altenrating map,
  then \(g \circ f\colon E [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] G\) is a continuous alternating map.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}%
  \label{thm:comp-clm}
  If \(g\colon F [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] G\) is a continuous altenrating map
  and \(f\colon E \to F\) is a continuous linear map
  then \(f^{*}g \colon E [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] G\) given by \(f^{*}g(\dots, x_{j}, \dots) = g (\dots, f(x_{j}), \dots)\) is a continuous alternating map.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Low order}%
\label{sec:low-order}

For \(k = 0\) and \(k = 1\), there are simple descriptions of the space of continuous altenrating forms,
given by the following definitions.

\begin{definition}
  If \(I\) is an empty type (e.g., \(\Fin 0\)),
  then the map sending the unique element of \(E^{I}\) to a constant \(c\)
  is a continuous alternating map.
  Moreover, this construction provides a continuous linear equivalence \(\mkZero\)
  between \(F\) and \(E [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] G\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  If \(I\) has a unique element \(i\) (e.g., \(I = \Fin 1\) and \(i = 0\)),
  then continuous alternating maps from \(E^{I}\) to \(F\) are just continuous linear maps from \(E\) to \(F\).
  The equivalence is given by \(\mkOne\).
\end{definition}

\subsection{Finite dimensional}%
\label{sec:finite-dimensional}

\begin{theorem}
  If the domain \(E\) is a finite dimensional topological vector space with Hausdorff topology,
  then any multilinear map from \(E\) is continuous.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If the domain \(E\) is a finite dimensional topological vector space with Hausdorff topology,
  then any alternating map from \(E\) is continuous.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Basis}%
\label{sec:basis}

\todo[inline]{Define a basis on the space of (continuous) alternating maps given bases in the domain and in the codomain.}

\subsection{Alternatization}%
\label{sec:alternatization}

\todo[inline]{Write a section about alternatization and why we rarely use it (avoid division by currying instead).}

\subsection{Currying}%
\label{sec:currying}

\begin{theorem}
  If \(f\colon E [\bigwedge^{k + 1}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\) is a \((k + 1)\)-alternating map and \(v\) is a vector,
  then \(f_{v}\colon E [\bigwedge^{k}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\) given by
  \[
    f_{v}(x_{0}, \dots, x_{k - 1})=f(v, x_{0}, \dots, x_{k - 1})
  \]
  is a \(k\)-alternating map.
  Moreover, this map is linear in \(f\) and \(v\), so we can define
  \begin{align}
    \curryOne&\colon (E [\bigwedge^{k + 1}]\to L[\mathbb k] F) \to L[\mathbb k] E \to L[\mathbb k] E [\bigwedge^{k}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\\
    (\curryOne f)(v)(x) &= f(v, x).
  \end{align}
\end{theorem}

\todo[inline]{Define currying for \(k + l\)-alternating maps.}
\begin{definition}%
  \label{def:alt-one}
  Let \(f\colon E^{k + 1}\to F\) be a continuous multilinear map which is alternating in all but the first variable.
  Formally, we represent this as \(f\) being a continuous linear map on \(E\) taking values in the space of continuous alternating maps \(E^{k}\to F\).
  Define the \emph{uncurrying} or \emph{\(1\)-alternatization} of \(f\) to be the continuous alternating map given by
  \[
    \altOne(f)(x_{0}, \dots, x_{k}) = \sum_{j=0}^{k}{(-1)}^{j}f(x_{j}, x_{0}, \dots, \widehat{x_{j}}, \dots, x_{k}),
  \]
  where \(\widehat{x_{j}}\) means that \(x_{j}\) is removed from the sequence.
  Here \({(-1)}^{j}\) is the sign of the cyclic permutation \((0, \dots, j)\).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  If \(f\) is a continuous \(k\)-alternating map, then \(\altOne(\curryOne f) = (k + 1)f\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
  We do not divide the result of \autoref{def:alt-one} by \(k + 1\)
  to ensure that it works if \(\mathbb k\) has a positive characteristic.%
  \todo{Are there any nontrivially normed fields of positive characteristic?}
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
  Let \(f\colon E^{k + 2}\to F\) be a continuous multilinear map which is alternating in all but the first two variables.
  If \(f\) is symmetric in the first two variables, then \(\altOne(\altOne(f)) = 0\).
\end{theorem}


\begin{definition}
  Let \(f\colon E^{k + l}\to F\) be a continuous multilinear map
  which is alternating in the first \(k\) argument and in the other \(l\) arguments.
  Then \(\altAdd_{k,l}(f)\) is the continuous alternating map given by
  \[
    \altAdd_{k,l}(f)(x_{0}, \dots, x_{k + l - 1})=\sum_{\substack{s\subseteq [0, k + l)\\|s|=k}}{(-1)}^{\sign \sigma_{s}}f(\sigma_{s}(0), \dots, \sigma_{s}(k + l - 1)),
  \]
  where \(\sigma_{s}\) is a permutation of \(\Fin (k + l)\) that sends \(s\) to \([0, k)\) and its complement to \([k, k + l)\).
  The exact choice of \(\sigma_{s}\) is not important, but we choose the permutation that is monotone both on \(s\) and on its complement.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  If \(k = 1\), then \(\altAdd_{1, l}(\mkOne(f)) = \altAdd_{1}(f)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  If \(f\) is a continuous alternating map, then \(\curry_{k, l}(\altAdd_{k, l}(f)) = \binom{k + l}{k}f\).
\end{theorem}

\section{Wedge product}%
\label{sec:wedge-product}

\begin{definition}
  Consider a continuous bilinear map \(f \colon E' \times F' \to G\)
  and continuous alternating maps \(g\colon E^{I}\to E'\) and \(h\colon F^{J}\to F'\).
  Then the formula
  \[
    f \circ_{2} (g, h)(v, w) = f(g(v), h(w))
  \]
  defines a continuous multilinear map \(E^{I}\times F^{J}\to G\)
  which is alternating both in the first \(I\) variables and in the other \(J\) variables.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let \(f \colon F \times G \to H\) be a continuous bilinear map.
  Let \(\omega \colon E^{k} \to F\) and \(\eta\colon E^{l}\to G\) be continuous alternating maps.
  Then the \emph{wedge product} of \(\omega\) and \(\eta\) with respect to \(f\) is given by
  \[
    \omega \wedge_{f} \eta = \altAdd_{k, l}(f \circ_{2}(g, h)).
  \]
\end{definition}

The most common case is \(F = G = H = \mathbb k\) and \(f\) is the multiplication,
but other bilinear maps (e.g., the inner product on a Hilbert space) are useful in some cases.

\chapter{Differential forms on a normed space}%
\label{cha:differential-forms-normed-space}

In this chapter we study differential forms on a normed vector space.
We use notation \(\Omega^{k}(E, F)\) for the space of differential \(k\)-forms on \(E\) taking values in \(F\),
where a \(k\)-form is a map from \(E\) to \(E [\bigwedge^{I}]\to L[\mathbb k] F\).

For now, we only consider real \(k\)-forms, though we may generalize the notion to any field in the future.
\todo{Generalize \(k\)-forms to any field; if a field isn't \(\mathbb R\) or \(\mathbb C\), then only analytic \(k\)-forms satisfy \(d^{2}=0\).}

All pointwise operations (arithmetic, compositions with continuous linear map, currying).

\section{Pullback}%
\label{sec:pullback}

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{pullback} of \(\omega\in \Omega^{k}(F, G)\) along a map \(f\colon E\to F\) within a set \(s\)
  is the \(k\)-form \(f_{s}^{*}\omega\) given by \(f^{*}\omega(x) = {(d_{s}f(x))}^{*}\omega(f(x))\),
  where \(d_{s}f(x)\) is the Fr√©chet derivative of \(f\) within \(s\) at \(x\),
  and the right-hand side is defined in~\autoref{thm:comp-clm}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{pullback} of \(\omega\in \Omega^{k}(F, G)\) along a map \(f\colon E\to F\)
  is the pullback of \(\omega\) along \(f\) within the universal set in the domain.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  The pullback \(f_{s}^{*}\omega\) within a set is a continuous linear map in \(\omega\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  The pullback \(f^{*}\omega\) is a continuous linear map in \(\omega\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  The pullback (within a set) of the \(0\)-form given by a function \(f\colon F\to G\) along a map \(g\colon E\to F\)
  is the \(0\)-form given by the function \(f\circ g\).

  Note that this statement is true even if \(g\) is not differentiable.
\end{theorem}

\todo[inline]{Formulate a similar statement about the pullback of the wedge product of forms.}

\section{Exterior derivative}%
\label{sec:exterior-derivative}

\begin{definition}%
  \label{def:ederivWithin}
  Consider a differential \(k\)-form \(\omega \in \Omega^{k}(E, F)\).
  By definition, its Fr√©chet derivative within a set \(s\) at a point \(x\)
  is a continuous linear map taking values in the space of continuous alternating maps from \(E^{k}\) to \(F\).
  The \emph{exterior derivative} of \(\omega\) \emph{within} \(s\) is the \((k + 1)\)-form \(d_{s}\omega\in\Omega^{k + 1}(E, F)\)
  that sends each \(x\) to the uncurrying of this Fr√©chet derivative.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}%
  \label{def:ederiv}
  The \emph{exterior derivative} of a differential \(k\)-form \(\omega\)
  is its exterior derivative within the universal set in the domain.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  Assume that \(\omega\) is twice differentiable within \(s\) at \(x\)
  and the second derivatives commute. Then \(d_{s}(d_{s}\omega) = 0\).
  The latter condition automatically holds, if the base field is
  \(\mathbb R\) or \(\mathbb C\) and \(s\) is a convex set with
  nonempty interior.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  The pullback commutes with the exterior derivative.
  \todo[inline]{What are the exact assumptions?}
  \todo[inline]{Write a proof.}
