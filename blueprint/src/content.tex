  A \emph{continuous alternating map} from \(E^{I}\) to \(F\),
  where \(E\) and \(F\) are topological vector spaces
  over a nontrivially normed field \(\mathbb k\)
  and \(I\) is an index type (usually, \texttt{Fin n} for some \(n\)),
  is a map \(f\colon E^{I} \to F\) such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(f(x_{1}, \dots, x_{n - 1})\) is linear in each variable \(x_{i}\);
  \item \(f\) is a continuous map.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
